## Overview
I wrangled in statistics of the NBA regular season. I cleaned the data and performed exploratory data analysis with dplyr and ggplot2. Finally, I created an interactive app with Shiny. You can view the deployed app here: https://kiwibp.shinyapps.io/nbashiny/.
## Installation
You will need to use the Shiny framework to execute the code. https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/.
