<h3>Notes about the "raw stats"</h3>
<p>
   I realize that there are many people who may have different needs for stats 
in a raw format.  I am trying to use the format that helps the most people.
<p>
   The stats will be for all players in the league in alphabetical format.  
Unfortunately, I have to use 'preformatting' to get it to look good.  
<p><b>NOTE</b>
As of the 06-07 season, I'll have one raw data file for player's cumulative stats & a separate one with a line for each team that they played.
each team they've played for that year.  
<p><b>NOTE</b>
Due to parsing issues, I no longer get flagrant fouls
<p>
The stats are currently in the following 
format.
<p>
<pre>
player team pos gp min fgm fga 3m 3a ftm fta or tr as st to bk pf tc ej ff pts

where:  player = player name  (either: last,first -or- last)
	team   = team name (3 letter abrev)
	pos    = player's position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C or ??)
	gp     = games played
	min    = total minutes played
	fgm    = field goals made
	fga    = field goals attempted
	3m     = threes made
	3a     = threes attempted
	ftm    = free throws made
	fta    = free throws attempted
	or     = offensive rebounds
	tr     = total rebounds
	as     = assists
	st     = steals
	to     = turnovers
	bk     = blocks
	ba     = blocked attempts (Note, there is little quality here, so far)
	pf     = personal fouls
	dq     = disqualifications
	pts    = total points
	tc     = technicals
	sta    = games started
