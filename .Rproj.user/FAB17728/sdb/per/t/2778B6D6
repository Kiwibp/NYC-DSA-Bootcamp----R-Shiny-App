    "contents" : "Notes about the \"raw stats\"\n\nI realize that there are many people who may have different needs for stats in a raw format. I am trying to use the format that helps the most people.\n\nThe stats will be for all players in the league in alphabetical format. Unfortunately, I have to use 'preformatting' to get it to look good.\n\nNOTE As of the 06-07 season, I'll have one raw data file for player's cumulative stats & a separate one with a line for each team that they played. each team they've played for that year.\n\nNOTE Due to parsing issues, I no longer get flagrant fouls\n\nThe stats are currently in the following format.\n\nplayer team pos gp min fgm fga 3m 3a ftm fta or tr as st to bk pf tc ej ff pts\n\nwhere:  player = player name  (either: last,first -or- last)\n\tteam   = team name (3 letter abrev)\n\tpos    = player's position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C or ??)\n\tgp     = games played\n\tmin    = total minutes played\n\tfgm    = field goals made\n\tfga    = field goals attempted\n\t3m     = threes made\n\t3a     = threes attempted\n\tftm    = free throws made\n\tfta    = free throws attempted\n\tor     = offensive rebounds\n\ttr     = total rebounds\n\tas     = assists\n\tst     = steals\n\tto     = turnovers\n\tbk     = blocks\n\tba     = blocked attempts (Note, there is little quality here, so far)\n\tpf     = personal fouls\n\tdq     = disqualifications\n\tpts    = total points\n\ttc     = technicals\n\tsta    = games started\n\t\nNotes about the \"raw stats\"\n\nThe stats will be for each team in the following format:\n\nteam won lost min fgm fga 3m 3a ftm fta or tr as st to bk pf tc ej ff pts\n\nwhere:  team   = team name \n\twon    = games won\n\tlost   = games lost\n\tmin    = total minutes played\n\tfgm    = field goals made\n\tfga    = field goals attempted\n\t3m     = threes made\n\t3a     = threes attempted\n\tftm    = free throws made\n\tfta    = free throws attempted\n\tor     = offensive rebounds\n\ttr     = total rebounds\n\tas     = assists\n\tst     = steals\n\tto     = turnovers\n\tbk     = blocks\n\tpf     = personal fouls\n\ttc     = technicals\n\tej     = ejections\n\tff     = flagrant fouls\n\tpts    = total points\n\t\n\nNote: This page is updated weekly on Thursdays. Players must have played at least 70 minutes this season to appear on this page. Percentage of Workload Stats\n\nPercentage of Workload = (Players Avg. Stat)/(Team’s Avg Stat)\n\nOther Advanced Statistics\neFG% – Adjusted field goal percentage based on the idea that 3 pointers are 50% more valuable than 2 point field goals.

O-Rt – Points Contributed to by Player Per 100 Possessions D-Rt – Points Allowed by Player Per 100 Possessions.\n\nTeam Advanced Statistics\nPF – Player Fouls Per Game O-Rt – Points Per 100 Possessions D-Rt – Points Allowed Per 100 Possessions.

Ast% – Percentage of field goals made from an assist Reb% – Percentage of missed shots rebounded by team AST/TO – Assists Divided by Turnovers TORatio – Teams Plays per game ending in a turnover\n\nPlayer Touches Advanced Stats\nTCH/G – Number of times a player touches the ball per game. Tch/Min – Number of touches per minute played PossTm – Average time per game where the player possesses the ball Post – Touches in the post Paint – Touches in the paint PPG – Points Per Game Pts/Tch – Points Scored Divided by Touches Per Game FPPG – Fantasy Points Per Game FP/Tch – Fantasy Points Per Game Divided by Touches Per Game\n\nPER attempts to assign a value to each player to demonstrate his worth on a per-minute basis. PER awards points for positive plays and subtracts for negative ones. \nWhat is PER?\nPER is a metric that aims to measure a player’s effectiveness with a single number. It\ntakes into account almost all statistics kept by the NBA, and weighs the player’s\nproduction by minutes played per game, and number of team possessions per game.\n",
